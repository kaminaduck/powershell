 A repo of all powershell scripts I've written

Adobe_Flash_Remove.ps1
This is a script I wrote to automate the folder deletion. I wrote it because I had to remove Adobe Flash off of 50ish servers, and I didn't want to do it manually.

This script is written to be run in the same directory as the Adobe uninstaller. Find it at https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-windows.html
