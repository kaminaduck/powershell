# powershell
 A repo of all powershell scripts I've written. These can be used independently of each other.

# Adobe_Flash_Remove.ps1
This is a script I wrote to automate the folder deletion. I wrote it because I had to remove Adobe Flash off of 50ish servers, and I didn't want to do it manually.

This script is written to be run in the same directory as the Adobe uninstaller. Find it at https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-windows.html

# Splunk_Ent_7x_STIG.ps1
This script took a lot of repetitive work off of my hands. Most of the automation in this is checking values in .conf files with established baseline configurations. I will attempt to keep this updated as time allows, but most of the work on this lately has been to make it useable in any Windows environment.
