# duck-powershell
 A repo of all powershell scripts I've written
 
 This will be a working place where all of my powershell scripts can be run.
 A list of all powershell scripts will be included in this file as they are developed.
 Each sub-folder will contain a detailed readme of the powershell script, to include any values that may need to be modified for the user's environment.
